# [Nick Hendren Portfolio] - [Visit nickhendren.com](http://www.nickhendren.com)

nickhendren.com is the portfolio site for Nick Hendren. It contains all of the projects I completed for [General Assembly's Web Development Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive].

nickhendren.com utilized [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/) as a template for the site and uses HTML/CSS and Javascript. There is a contact form using PHP that is currently unused and will be implemented in the near future.
